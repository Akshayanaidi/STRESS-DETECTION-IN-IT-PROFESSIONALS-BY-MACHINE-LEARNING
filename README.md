Stress management systems play a significant role to detect the stress levels which disrupts our socio economic 
lifestyle. As World Health Organization (WHO) says, Stress is a mental health problem affecting the life of 
one in four citizens. Human stress leads to mental as well as socio-fiscal problems, lack of clarity in work, 
poor working relationship, depression and finally commitment of suicide in severe cases. This demands 
counselling to be provided for the stressed individuals cope up against stress. Stress avoidance is impossible 
but preventive actions helps to overcome the stress. Currently, only medical and physiological experts can 
determine whether one is under depressed state (stressed) or not. One of the traditional method to detect stress 
is based on questionnaire. This method completely depends on the answers given by the individuals, people 
will be tremulous to say whether they are stressed or normal. Automatic detection of stress minimizes the risk 
of health issues and improves the welfare of the society. This paves the way for the necessity of a scientific 
tool, which uses physiological signals thereby automating the detection of stress levels in individuals. Stress 
detection is discussed in various literatures as it is a significant societal contribution that enhances the lifestyle 
of individuals. Ghaderi et al. analysed stress using Respiration, Heart rate (HR), facial electromyography 
(EMG), Galvanic skin response (GSR) foot and GSR hand data with a conclusion that, features pertaining to 
respiration process are substantial in stress detection. Maria Viqueira et al. describes mental stress prediction 
using a standalone stress sensing hardware by interfacing GSR as the only physiological sensor . David Liu et 
al. proposed a research to predict stress levels solely from Electrocardiogram (ECG). Multimodal sensor 
efficacy to detect stress of working people is experimentally discussed in . This employs the sensor data from 
sensors such as pressure distribution, HR,Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) and Electrodermal activity (EDA). An 
eye tracker sensor is also used which systematically analyses the eye movements with the stressors like Stroop 
word test and information related to pickup tasks.The authors of performed perceived stress detection by a set 
of noninvasive sensors which collects the physiological signals such as ECG , GSR, Electroencephalography 
(EEG), EMG, and Saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2). Continuous stress levels are estimated using the 
physiological sensor data such as GSR, EMG, HR, Respiration in. The stress detection is carried out effectively 
using Skin conductance level (SCL), HR, Facial EMG sensors by creating ICT related Stressors. Automated 
stress detection is made possible by several pattern recognition algorithms. Every sensor data is compared 
with a stress index which is a threshold value used for detecting the stress level. The authors of collected data 
from 16 individuals under four stressor conditions which were tested with Bayesian Network, J48 algorithm 
and Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm for predicting stress. Statistical features of heart rate, 
GSR , frequency domain features of heart rate and its variability (HRV), and the power spectral components 
of ECG were used to govern the stress levels. Various features are extracted from the commonly used 
physiological signals such as ECG, EMG, GSR, BVP etc., measured using appropriate sensors and selected 
features are grouped into clusters for further detection of anxiety levels . In, it is concluded that smaller clusters 
result in better balance in stress detection using the selected General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) 
model. This results in the fact that different combinations of the extracted features from the sensor signals 
provide better solutions to predict the continuous anxiety level.# STRESS-DETECTION-IN-IT-PROFESSIONALS-BY-MACHINE-LEARNING
The main motive of our project is to detect stress in the IT professionals using  Machine learning and Image  processing techniques.
